## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an event where participants solve daily coding challenges that typically involve algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving skills. These challenges are released every day from December 1st to December 25th.

Learn more about Advent of Code at [Advent of Code Website](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Solutions Overview

Here, you'll find my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges. Each day's challenge is solved in a separate directory, and the solution is provided in the form of code files (e.g., Python, JavaScript, etc.) and any associated input or output files required for running the code.

## Structure

The repository structure is organized by days:

```
├── [year]/
│   ├── [day]/
│   │   ├── [implementation file]
│   │   ├── [test file](optional)
│   │   └── demo1.txt
│   │   └── demo2.txt
│   │   └── input1.txt
│   │   └── input2.txt
│   ├── [day+1]/
│   │   ...

```

Each day's directory contains:
- `implementation file`: The file with the implementation of the solutions of the day.
- `test file`: an optional test file
- `demo[1/2].txt`: the small example of the puzzle.
- `input[1/2].txt`: the puzzle input you have to use to get the final solution.

## Usage

To use these solutions:

1. Navigate to the directory of the specific day.
2. Run the code file using your preferred programming language's interpreter/compiler.

For example, in Node:

```bash
node 2023/01/index.js
